# Hello World, by Yash Soni
My very first project that I proudly created in Unity. It wasn't too hard, but it was more than enough to dip my toes into Unity. It took me about 15 min to finish it. One thing I liked was the simplicity of this project, and the chellanging part was to get all the settings right.
